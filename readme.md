FireBlock is a simple addon that blocks sites based on regexes. 
There's not much else to say about it, really. Simply add a few
regexes in the settings and away you fly. Every time you visit
a site that matches it, it well step in and let you know.

Great for focus. Great for productivity. Minimal.

To get started, [install the addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireblocks1/) 
and go to the addon's preferences where you can add any valid regex, 
seperated by newlines.
