FireBlock is a simple addon that blocks sites based on regexes. 
There's not much else to say about it, really. Simply add a few
regexes in the settings and away you fly. Every time you visit
a site that matches it, it well step in and let you know.

Great for focus. Great for productivity. Minimal.

To get started, install the addon and go to the addon's preferences
where you can add any valid regex, seperated by newlines.
